# Task C: Product Package Counter #
# Task: You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos. #

# Hint: Loops #

# Client Task C #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

# Need to have 3 variables #
#   max which will equal 50 #
#   increment which will equal 2 #
#   current which will be the current count #

START
    Set max = 50
    Set increment = 2
    Set current = 0

    While current < max
        current = current + increment
        PRINT current
