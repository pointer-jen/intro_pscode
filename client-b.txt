# Task B: Find the Spot #
# Task: Develop a mapping (walking) application to find a specific set location in a large warehouse store for a customer. The customer can move north, south, east, or west. #

# Hints: Loops, Variables #

# Client Task B #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

# Will need 3 Variables to track all will need x and y coordinates #
#   start - used to set starting point #
#   target - used to set target location #
#   current - used to set current location #
# Will also need direction to track what they input for move #

START
    SET start to (x_start, y_start)
    SET target to (x_target, y_target)
    SET current to start

While current != target
    PRINT "You are at" + current
    PRINT "Enter direction to move (north, south, east, west): "
    Input from user = direction

    IF direction = "north"
        y_current = y_current + 1
    ELSE if direction = "south"
        y_current = y_current - 1
    ELSE if direction = "east"
        x_current = x_current + 1
    ELSE if direction = "west"
        x_current - x_current - 1
    ELSE
        PRINT "Invalid direction.  Please enter north, south, east, or west"
    
    IF current = target
        PRINT "Congrats you reached your destination!"
    ELSE
        PRINT "You are currently at" + current
        PRINT "Your target is at" + target
